Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room client's program was called "Draw It or Lose it" and was a game based on an old gameshow. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.
  
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  In this documentation I used extensive researhc into different operating platforms to best provide a recommendation for how and where the client's software should run.
  
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I found the tables particularly helpful in organizing the benefits and downfalls of each operating platform from various points of view.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would revise the section of research I did on client operating platofrms, as I should have focused more on the differences between client browsers. 
  
 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I simply acknowledged each requirement the user had specificied and thought about how to best implement those requirements throughtout each step of design and development. This is important to ensure that the product you're developing for a client is actually what they want.
   
   
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached designing software by considering how each component of the application would impact the user experience and end result. In the future, I'd like to combine this focus with additional considerations to the client's request in order to better understand them and perhaps suggest alternatives or solutions to their problems.
